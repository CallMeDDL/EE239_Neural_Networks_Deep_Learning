- Tools: Pytorch

Using datasets collected from electroencephalography (EEG) we are trying and comparing different CNN and RNN architectures and optimizing the classification accuracy across all subjects.

We trained different models to predict peopleâ€™s action according to the signals of their electrodes. First, we start with basic models including CNN, LSTM and AutoEncoder. Then, we explore some methods like shallow CNN, time series analysis and weighted regularization to optimize our model. Eventually the best test accuracy we can get is 64.11%
